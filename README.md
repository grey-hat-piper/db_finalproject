# ðŸ›’ Easy-buy E-commerce Database

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Easy-buy is a **relational database system** built using **MySQL** for a campus-focused e-commerce store.  
It is designed to allow **students in a university** to buy and sell items easily, while maintaining a **well-structured, normalised, and efficient database**.  

The database supports:  
- Managing **customers (students)** and their addresses  
- Managing **products** with categories and stock  
- Tracking **orders, payments, and carts**  
- Enforcing **constraints** (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL)  
- Supporting different **relationships** (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)  

The schema is fully normalised up to **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**.
